Any traders identified as having opened a position during a News Event are subject to having that position closed and the associated P&L removed from their account, having the leverage on their account reduced or having their account breached altogether. The Company has sole and absolute discretion in determining what constitutes a News Event. This rule is intended to protect the integrity of our program and is not meant to penalize traders who inadvertently trade through a news event.</li>

Additionally, and before any Trader shall receive a funded account, the trading activity of the Trader under these Terms and Conditions shall be reviewed by both the Company and the Broker to determine whether such trading activity constitutes Prohibited Trading. In the case of Prohibited Trading, the Trader shall not receive a funded account.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, the Company reserves the right to disallow or block any Trader from participating in the program for any reason, in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion.</p>

                                <p>Prohibition of Gambling Practices:</p>
                                <p>Engaging in inappropriate risk management practices, such as gambling, “all-in” trading, or excessively leveraging positions, is strictly prohibited. Trading activity that resembles gambling—such as consistently placing trades prior to news releases or other binary events—will not be tolerated.</p>
                                <p>Excessive risk-taking and gambling are defined by the percentage of an account risked in a single trade or across a series of trades or positions. An “all-in” trade refers to committing all or a substantial portion of available capital or margin to a single trade. Similarly, excessive and improper use of leverage occurs when a trader risks a significant portion of their account in one trade or across a series of one-directional trades and positions.</p>
                                <p>If you are found to be engaging in such activities, the Company reserves the right to immediately close your account and such closure may include the forfeiture of any fees owed to you by the Company, in the Company’s sole discretion.</p>

                                <p>Copy Trading</p>
                                <p>Copy trading from one account to another is only permitted if the trader owns all the accounts in question.</p>
                                <p>Group trading, signal services, passing services, or any other methods that bypass individual strategy are not allowed.</p>
                                <p>Engaging in trades that mirror or closely align with another trader or group of traders across multiple accounts is strictly prohibited.</p>
                                <p>Using automated trading systems (EAs) or third-party trading strategies that facilitate copy trading is strictly prohibited.</p>

                                <p class="text-gemscend-dark-emerald-75">Reverse Trading/Group Hedging</p>
                                <p>Hedging or executing reverse trades within a single account is not a prohibited trading activity.</p>
                                <p>Executing a buy trade on one account and a sell trade on another account, or vice versa, is strictly prohibited.</p>

                                <p>The Company does not provide any trader education. The intent of The Company is to identify individuals with a talent for trading. No live trading is provided directly by the Company.

As such, you agree not to hold the Company liable for any possible claims of damages that may arise from any decision that you make based upon the use of data, information, and content on the Company website.</p>
                                <p>While the Company does not provide you with the opportunity to invest actual currency, the Company wants to make sure you understand the risks involved with traditional investing. You should be aware that the risk of trading and investing is high and substantial. It can work for you as well as against you. It may or may not lead to substantial losses. Additionally, past performance is not indicative of future results.</p>
                                <p>As such, you should carefully consider whether trading and investing is right for you depending on your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. If you are unsure, you should consult with a financial advisor and/or tax advisor.</p>
